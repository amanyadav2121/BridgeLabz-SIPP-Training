// Write a program to create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers (floating point) and perform all the operations
// Hint => 
// Create a variable number1 and number 2 and take user inputs.
// Perform Arithmetic Operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and assign the result to a variable and finally print the result
// I/P => number1, number2
// O/P => The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division value of 2 numbers ___ and ___ is ___, ____, ____, and ___


import java.util.Scanner;

public class basicCalculator_11 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double number1 = sc.nextDouble();
        double number2 = sc.nextDouble();

        double addition = number1 + number2;
        double subtraction = number1 - number2;
        double multiplication = number1 * number2;
        double division = number1 / number2;
